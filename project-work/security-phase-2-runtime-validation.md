# Security Phase 2 — real runtime and controlled provider validation

Status: BUILDER ACTION REQUIRED
Phase: Security Phase 2 — API / storage / rotation validation
Actor: Builder

## Accepted baseline

Security Phase 1 is accepted on `main` at `da934936edafcf892ebab33e870e6f5f511d147f` with Reviewer verdict `Proceed with safeguards`.

Phase 2 must complete before any Phase 3 Service Manager / Service Element work begins.

## Authority/read order

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/ai-index.md`
3. `docs/roadmap.md`
4. `docs/code-map/settings-station.md`
5. `docs/architecture/credential-broker-contract.md`
6. authoritative Settings/Connections/Security source
7. `skills/qsd-platform-architecture/SKILL.md` if any new identity/entity boundary appears

## Phase 2 safeguards — binding

1. Any `qsd/v1` broker flow must derive WordPress user identity and caller/component identity server-side. Client input may request operation/subject only; it must not choose another user id or invent caller authority.
2. Credential storage, request-key claim/consume/replay/expiry, and rotation/re-seal must be validated on a real WordPress + real database runtime, not only fake-`$wpdb` tests.
3. Real key material, one real provider credential, and one real provider call are allowed only as controlled Phase 2 validation through the accepted broker boundary. Never commit, log, echo, project, or return secrets.
4. Service Element identity remains deferred to Phase 3. Do not reopen or implement it here.

## Builder package

Use one substantial topic branch.

- Add only the minimum governed `qsd/v1` validation flow required to exercise the broker end-to-end.
- Derive authenticated WordPress user and allow-listed caller identity server-side.
- Add the minimum provider validation scope/operation needed for a connection/authentication test. Do not add importer/product mapping behavior.
- Validate encrypted credential save/read state against real WordPress option storage.
- Validate request-key issue → atomic consume → replay rejection → expiry/binding rejection against the real database.
- Validate key rotation/re-seal on real stored encrypted credentials, including fail-closed behavior.
- Perform one controlled real provider call through the broker and record only safe result metadata.
- Update the credential-broker contract, Settings Code Map and roadmap only where Phase 2 reality changes current authority.
- Preserve deterministic tests and run `npm test` and `npm run docs:check`.

## Exit gate

Phase 2 is not complete until Reviewer has evidence for:
- server-derived user/caller identity;
- real WordPress/database storage and broker consume behavior;
- real rotation/re-seal behavior;
- no-secret REST/storage/audit output;
- one controlled provider call through the broker;
- exact pushed SHA and deterministic validation.

## Hard exclusions / stop gates

Stop rather than guess for any new Platform ID family, destructive migration/purge, production deployment, widened deployment path, Service Element identity decision, importer/mapping work, or provider behavior beyond the minimum controlled validation operation.

No staging or production deployment unless separately authorised by the Owner.

## Handoff

Push the exact topic SHA, update this same file to `AWAITING REVIEWER REVIEW` with runtime evidence and redacted/safe provider-call evidence, then stop. Do not begin Phase 3.
