// EntityDrawerHostBridge — the neutral seam between a host drawer shell and a
// reusable entity drawer composition (Service, Tier, …).
//
// A composition renders the mature module presentation and owns its own
// module-level edit state and lifecycle dialogs. It reports only host-level
// concerns — the record-level footer, a close-guard, the actual close, and a
// post-mutation refresh — through this bridge, so the SAME composition mounts
// under any host that can satisfy it.
//
// Two hosts can satisfy it:
//   - Old Command Centre: its ActionShell host context — `setFooter`,
//     `setCloseGuard`, `close`, and the `onRefresh` handle map 1:1 here. See
//     ServiceViewStep / ServiceTierStep, now thin adapters over this bridge.
//   - New Admin Station: the generic drawer shell renders the supplied footer,
//     honours the guard, and mounts the same neutral compositions.
//
// It names no host and no entity: contracts cross bundle boundaries, renderers
// do not.

  // never calls this renders the host's own registered title unchanged, and
  // the host itself guarantees this never stays stuck overridden when the
  // open drawer's content changes to something else.
