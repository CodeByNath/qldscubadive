// The record inputs the Service drawer needs. These mirror exactly what the old
// host handed the step through stepData: a seed ServiceItem (the hook fetches the
// authoritative detail from `service.id`), the package summaries, and the
// category list for the overview editor. The Admin Station adapter resolves the
// same three from a numeric recordId before mounting the composition.
//
// `service: null` addresses no stored post yet — the Settings lane's Create
// Service launcher opens this SAME composition against the stable `'new'`
// recordId sentinel. No fake numeric id stands in for it anywhere: the
// pending Overview draft lives in useServiceStation's own local state, and
// `service` only becomes non-null once a complete Overview Save creates the
// persisted Pending Service record with its Overview draft (mirrors Package
// Family's `'new'` sentinel, without widening
// ServiceItem.id to carry it).
