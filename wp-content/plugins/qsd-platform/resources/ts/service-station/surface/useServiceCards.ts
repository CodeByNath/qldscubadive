// Service cards — the read boundary for the Service presentation wall.
//
// The one place the Admin Station reads the Service catalogue for a presentation
// region. It reads the current-scope catalogue route, maps each row through the
// pure card adapter, and returns the collection state every template kit
// consumes ({ items, loading, error, refetch }).
//
// Bundle boundary: `useApi` and `fetchAdminCatalog` are pure data/transport, and
// the card adapter is a pure projection. Nothing from the Command Centre tree is
// pulled in — notably NOT ServiceCatalogStation, which owns the same read in the
// legacy tree.

 * don't rebuild the card array.
 *
 * `refetch` is the handle this wall hands to the drawer it opens, so a saved
 * service refreshes THIS wall. The collection is retained across that reload, so
 * the cards update in place instead of blanking (see useRetainedCollection).
