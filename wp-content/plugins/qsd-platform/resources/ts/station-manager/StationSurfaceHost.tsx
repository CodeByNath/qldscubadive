// Station surface host — the generic composer that turns a binding into a
// rendered surface.
//
// It resolves the binding's data source key to a read hook and its template kit
// key to a presentation kit, calls the source, and hands the collection to the
// kit. It holds no entity logic and names no entity: it is the single seam where
// a declared binding becomes live UI, so the shell can print any registered
// template into a placement region without branching.
//
// Rules of Hooks: the host calls exactly one data-source hook, chosen by key.
// The caller mounts it with a `key` that changes when the binding changes, so a
// resolved source is stable for the life of a mount — the selected hook never
// swaps under a live instance.
