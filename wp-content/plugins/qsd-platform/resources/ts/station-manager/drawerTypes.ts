// travels with the registration and Admin Station's shell decides what each

// or template key to pick a width — a drawer that needs more room says so in
// its own registration, and the size stays generic Admin presentation.

// field — the Package Family template compares a string group_id; a numerically
// keyed entity compares its number. `StationRecordId` stays string | number for
// exactly that reason, and no template converts: the id that opened the drawer
// is the id that reads and edits the record.

  // passed to `setFooter` in its footer region, and consults the guard passed to
  // `setCloseGuard` before closing from its own chrome (Escape / backdrop / header
  // close). Content that supplies neither behaves exactly as before — the footer
  // region stays absent and the shell closes directly. Module-level footers stay
  // inside the content; only whole-record actions belong here.
  //
  // These two, with `onClose` and `onSaved`, let the shell's content contract
  // satisfy the neutral EntityDrawerHostBridge (close = onClose, setFooter,

  // Approve/Cancel stay in the footer), the header reads more naturally
  // than a pinned-footer button. The shell resets this to `null` itself
  // whenever the open drawer's content identity changes, the same
  // guaranteed reset `setHeaderHidden` gets below, for the same reason: a
  // header action is shell chrome, not body content a remount naturally
  // clears via effect cleanup. Content that never calls this renders no
  // header action — every existing template is unaffected.
  setHeaderAction?: (action: ComponentChildren) => void;
  // Optional: content may ask the shell to hide its own header (title +

  // back control, and Cancel/Save — the parent header would be redundant
  // chrome above it. The shell resets this to `false` itself whenever the
  // open drawer's content identity changes, so no content can leave a
  // stale hidden header behind for a different record/drawer. Content that
  // never calls this behaves exactly as before — the header always shows.

  // static per-template title -- e.g. the Tier drawer's registered "Package
  // Tier" is right for a normal Tier/Add-on but wrong for a subordinate
  // record like the composable occupant, which is neither. The shell resets
  // this to `null` itself whenever the open drawer's content identity
  // changes, the same guaranteed reset `setHeaderHidden`/`setHeaderAction`
  // get above, for the same reason. Content that never calls this renders
