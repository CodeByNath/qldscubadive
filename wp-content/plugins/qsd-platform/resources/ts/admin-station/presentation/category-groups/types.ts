/*
 * Category Group cards — the presentation contract.
 *
 * The narrow, entity-shaped contract the Category Group card grid renders. It is
 * a PRESENTATION contract, not a station model: the future Category Station owns
 * the read and adapts its records into these shapes. Cards never fetch.
 *
 * Identity is carried by `id` (and the optional `key`) and nothing else. Every
 * action dispatch and drawer request travels by that identity, so no consumer
 * ever branches on a Category Group's name.
 *
 * Status and notifications deliberately reuse the platform's existing non-visual
 * contracts rather than restating them:
 *   - `CategoryGroupStatus` is the existing 5-state resolver vocabulary from
 *     drawer-kit/utils/moduleStatus.tsx; its label/class mapping is owned by the
 *     shared Presentation Status Contract in drawer-kit/schema/presentation.ts.
 *   - `CategoryGroupNotification` is the existing ModuleNote, re-exported through
 *     this narrow adapter so the card depends on the notification *contract*
 *     while the card adapter renders it through the shared notification UI.
 * Both imports are type-only and non-visual, matching the precedent set by
 * useServiceStation.

 * This kit is entity-neutral: it renders a Service Category Group (numeric
 * `term_id`) and a Package Family (string `group_id`) through the same cards. So
 * identity is the shell's shared {@link StationRecordId}, and each record keeps
 * its native form — a term_id stays a number, a group_id stays a string, and
 * neither is ever converted at this boundary. Converting is the one thing
 * forbidden: it is what would force a round-trip at the exact action boundary
 * that matters.
 *
 * The card holds the id only to render it back out on dispatch; it never parses,
 * compares, or interprets it.
