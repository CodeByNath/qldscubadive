# Service Backend Boundary

Global policy is defined by [AGENTS.md](../../../../../../AGENTS.md).

## Ownership and entry points

This module owns `cz_service` lifecycle, Service meta/drafts, category relationships written by its handlers, and Service inclusion/FAQ pools.

- `ServiceModule.php` — module wiring.
- `Http/ServiceController.php` — Service routes and validation/orchestration,
  including authenticated Platform-ID read delegation to numeric detail.
- `Support/ServiceSchema.php` — Service keys, module vocabulary, sanitization, and route arguments.
- `Support/ServicePools.php` — the one public pool-write contract used by Service and Package Tier saves.
- `Core\Plugin` injects the shared `PlatformIdentifierStation`; Service owns
  the `cz_platform_id` post-meta callbacks and `platform_id` projections while
  permanent reservation/binding/tombstones remain Platform-owned.

## Boundaries

There is no pass-through repository; WordPress post/meta persistence remains cohesive here. Cost Builder exclusively owns `cz_service_pricing`. Core registrars own centralized post-type/taxonomy declaration. Shared lifecycle/capability/pool-reference infrastructure remains in `Admin/Support`. Service-nested Package/Promotion URLs do not transfer their ownership here. Nothing outside this module imports `ServiceController` internals.

The Service frontend peer — contracts, state, presentation, and the Service drawer/editors/schema — lives at `resources/ts/service-station/`.
Backend `platform_id` is mapped by the Service endpoint boundary to application
`platformId`; it is output-only and never belongs in a writable payload.

Read [Service Station](../../../../../../docs/code-map/service-station.md) and [Service Catalogue](../../../../../../docs/code-map/service-catalogue.md).

## Validation

From the plugin root: `php tests/service-lifecycle-mask.php`,
`php tests/service-route-baseline.php`, `npm run contract:platform-identity-schema`,
`npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and `npm run docs:check`.
