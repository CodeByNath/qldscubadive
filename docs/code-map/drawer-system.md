# Drawer and Station System

The locked cross-Station lifecycle, pill, notification, child-lock, footer,
and travel contract is [Station and Drawer Lifecycle Contract v1](../architecture/StationDrawerLifecycleContract-v1.md).
Service, Service Category, Package Family, Tier occupant, and Tier Add-on
conform today. Tier Group / Tier System and the remaining Package surfaces keep
their separate inventory there.

## Responsibility split

The drawer system separates coordination, hosting, rendering, and persistence:

- **Station Manager** owns the open drawer contract, registration/resolution, record identity, and intent coordination.
- **Admin Station** owns the generic drawer shell and presentation/control chrome.
- **Owning Stations** register drawer adapters and own their compositions, validation, lifecycle, and saves.
- **Drawer Kit** supplies entity-neutral schema renderers and interaction primitives; it owns no records.

[drawerTypes.ts](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/station-manager/drawerTypes.ts) defines drawer contracts. [drawerTemplates.ts](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/station-manager/registry/drawerTemplates.ts) resolves templates. [AdminStationDrawer.tsx](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/admin-station/shell/drawer/AdminStationDrawer.tsx) hosts them and delegates identity, mode, close, footer, guard, and refresh. See [Admin Station Drawer](admin-station-drawer.md).

## Shared Drawer Kit

- [EntityDrawer.tsx](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/drawer-kit/EntityDrawer.tsx) renders placements, notifications, trailing content, and one edit session.
- [entityDrawerHost.ts](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/drawer-kit/entityDrawerHost.ts) defines the host-neutral close/footer/guard/mutation bridge.
- [InlineEditorShell.tsx](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/drawer-kit/InlineEditorShell.tsx) owns Save/Cancel, dirty confirmation, validation, loading, and errors — a specialisation of `FocusedTaskShell.tsx`.
- [EntityActionFooter.tsx](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/drawer-kit/EntityActionFooter.tsx) and [CanonicalEntityFooter.tsx](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/drawer-kit/CanonicalEntityFooter.tsx) provide footer grammar and lifecycle mapping.
- [SupportedActionFooter.tsx](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/drawer-kit/SupportedActionFooter.tsx) renders owner-supplied action descriptors; Tier Group and Tier use it for their supported sets.
- `ui/DrawerGroupTabs.tsx`, `DrawerGroupAccordion.tsx`, `drawerGroups.ts`, `ChildChipStrip.tsx`, `useScrollHide.ts`: additive multi-group content primitives ([contract §9–§12](../architecture/StationDrawerLifecycleContract-v1.md#9-drawer-group-presentation-tabs-accordion-child-navigation-and-focused-tasks)).
- `schema/types.ts` and `schema/{elements,shells}` define neutral entity, binding, placement, action, and edit-session contracts.

## Module entry contract

Platform-wide, for every drawer that presents modules. A drawer opens on its
**Overview screen**, never in an editor:

```text
drawer opens readable
  → the module renders, even with nothing in it
  → it carries its own pill from the 5-state vocabulary (empty ⇒ Pending)
  → the pill opens that module's notification panel, which states what is missing
  → the module offers Edit
  → only Edit opens the module's inline editor
```

Required consequences:

- **No explanation block above modules.** The empty module and pill are the guidance.
- **No entry-state editor**, including empty or not-yet-created records.
- **Status stays in the pill vocabulary.** `settled` / `not-configured` are transitions, not statuses.
- **Disabled is a user action, never a parent-lifecycle derivation.** It requires the explicit per-record signal written by the owning control.
- **Editor and Edit action come as a pair.**
- **One footer at a time.** While `InlineEditorShell` owns Save/Cancel the drawer withdraws its own.
- **Cancel returns to the readable module**; Close leaves.
- **Create surfaces render the record's own module**, never copied fields.

For a conforming new Station, complete Overview Save creates the persisted
Pending record, seeds authoritative detail, and transfers the returned native
ID into the same mounted drawer. Publish settles and activates that existing
record; it is never the create boundary. A raw unmasked `platform_status: 'disabled'` is Pending, not Disabled. Disabled requires the explicit Disable
mask; Enable and Restore clear it and return to Pending while preserving draft
data. Service child modules are Edit-locked only until Overview Save has issued
their ID; afterward child saves are authoritative Station writes.

Enforced by `npm run contract:drawer-module-entry`, which executes each rule and reads the compositions for the wiring they need, and by `node scripts/module-state-snapshot.mjs`, which pins every exported rule's `{ status, notes }`. Surfaces under it: empty Tier slots ([Tiers](tiers.md)), whole-instance Tier Rate Sheet access ([Package Home Settings](package-settings.md)), Tier registration ([Tier System Registration](tier-registration.md)), Family creation (the mature drawer's `'new'` identity), and the Rate Sheet pool ([Rate Sheet](rate-sheet.md)).

Package Family, Tier occupant, and Tier Add-on use the locked drawer/footer
grammar. Tier Group / Tier System uses shared presentation but retains its
separate Package-owned lifecycle. Tier Inclusion, Rate Sheet lifecycle, and Promotion
still have documented lifecycle differences and remain pending migration;
they must not be copied as the platform default. The full inventory is in the
contract's [conformance table](../architecture/StationDrawerLifecycleContract-v1.md#8-conformance-and-pending-inventory).

## Domain compositions and adapters

- `package-station/drawer/{package-family,tier}/` and `drawer/{schema,editors}/` are Package-owned. Their registered adapters are [PackageFamilyDrawerContent.tsx](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/package-station/surface/packageFamily/PackageFamilyDrawerContent.tsx) and [TierDrawerHost.tsx](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/package-station/surface/tierSurface/TierDrawerHost.tsx). The Tier host strictly distinguishes whole-instance `tier-instance:{instance}`, occupant `tier-instance:{instance}:{occupant}`, and empty-slot `tier-slot:{instance}:{slot}` routes; all reuse the registered `tier` key.
- `service-station/drawer/` is Service-owned; [ServiceDrawerHost.tsx](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/service-station/surface/ServiceDrawerHost.tsx) is its registered adapter.
- `entity-drawers/category/` and `entity-drawers/schema/` remain Category residue hosted through Admin Station's [CategoryDrawerHost.tsx](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/admin-station/stations/serviceCategory/CategoryDrawerHost.tsx).
- [drawerChrome.ts](../../wp-content/plugins/compuzign-platform/resources/ts/entity-drawers/shared/drawerChrome.ts) remains genuinely shared close/lifecycle/dialog coordination.

Controllers render no JSX; presentation calls no endpoints. Native identities pass through Station Manager unchanged.

## Validation

Run `node scripts/mode-renderer-snapshot.mjs`, `node scripts/module-state-snapshot.mjs`, `npm run contract:drawer-module-entry`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and `npm run docs:check` from the plugin root.
