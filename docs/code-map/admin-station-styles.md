# Admin Station Styles

The Admin Station uses scoped station tokens plus the shared drawer stylesheet. Shared presentation headings use the station type scale; home block gutters use the compact body rhythm. Theme selectors remain under `.cz-admin-station`, so the surrounding WordPress page does not inherit station visuals.

## Authoritative files

- `resources/ts/admin-station/styles/admin-station-tokens.css` — the single Admin Station token definition site. Light/dark station tokens plus the field-system contract; `--station-card-shadow` supplies shallow card depth separately from overlay `--station-shadow`.
- `resources/ts/admin-station/styles/admin-station.css` — shell, navigation, cards, drawer layer/backdrop/panel/sizes, the shared [list system](admin-station-list-system.md), and the Station-level feature surfaces (Service Catalogue, Service Category card, Tier Workspace Engine, lower deck, Tier settings, Rate Sheet tool).
- `resources/ts/admin-station/styles/admin-station-responsive.css` — responsive shell, card, catalogue, Tier-workspace and drawer rules. The Tier workspace collapses three columns to two at a component 1100px breakpoint, then to a single column at the 767px shell breakpoint.
- `resources/css/modules/drawer-kit.css` — drawer content: modules, status pills, notification panels, **the shared field system**, inline editors, dialogs, module actions, and record footers.

`resources/ts/modules/admin-station.ts` emits `dist/css/admin-station.css` in the order tokens → base → responsive. Vite builds `drawer-kit.css` as its own stable entry; `Core/AssetLoader.php` registers it once and makes the Admin Station sheet depend on it, so drawer-kit always precedes the station sheet.

`.cz-admin-station` is the only live root for both sheets.

## Ownership boundary

Three owners, no overlap. See [Admin Station Field System](../architecture/admin-station-field-system-v1.md) for the full specification.

**Shell CSS** (`admin-station.css`, `admin-station-tokens.css`, `admin-station-responsive.css`) owns station layout, header, navigation, body, footer, slide menu, presentation surfaces, station tabs and tab sets, the drawer layer, backdrop, drawer placement, drawer widths, station breakpoints, and every design token.

**Drawer/content CSS** (`drawer-kit.css`) owns drawer content sections, overview modules, field grids, field wrappers, labels, hints, control appearance, control states, control sizes, validation presentation, inline-edit layouts, and record footer contents.

**Feature CSS** owns only genuine domain layout: grids, rows, columns, specialised editor structures, relationship visualisation, and entity status presentation.

Feature CSS must not declare `border`, `border-radius`, `height`, `min-height`, `outline`, `box-shadow`, `background` or `color` on an `input`, `select`, `textarea`, `label` or a shared control class. Those belong to the field system. `scripts/admin-station-css-contract.mjs` enforces this.

## Field system

`cz-tf-*` in `drawer-kit.css` is the one Admin drawer field system: one wrapper (`.cz-tf-field`), one checkbox row inside it (`.cz-tf-field__inline`), one label (`.cz-tf-label`, with `--required`), one hint (`.cz-tf-hint`), one error (`.cz-tf-error`), and one control base (`.cz-tf-control`) specialised by `.cz-tf-input`, `.cz-tf-select`, `.cz-tf-textarea` and `.cz-tf-checkbox`. `.cz-tf-control__inner` is the bare input inside a composite control surface, such as the catalogue search.

Three sizes — `--sm`, default, `--lg` — and the states default / hover / focus-visible / disabled / readonly / error / required are declared once on the base and inherited by every type. No second field system may be created.

Checkboxes omit the base: its `appearance: none` would erase the native tick.

The default size is `--station-control-height`, so a drawer field and a station-page filter are the same control. `--station-field-*` is the whole contract; every name aliases an existing station family or a 4px-rhythm value.

Editors render fields through `drawer-kit/fields/AdminField`, not hand-authored markup. Specialised editors — the Rate Sheet grid, the repeatable FAQ and inclusion collections, the transforming category control — keep their own layout and consume the shared control classes.

## Responsive rules

- The list system stacks both its shapes at a 980px component breakpoint.
- Home gutters and card columns change at 767px.
- Header pill compaction uses 720px; at 560px the pills hide and the drawer becomes full viewport width.
- Shared record footers wrap at the drawer-kit 480px breakpoint.

## Token namespaces

`--station-*` is the Admin Station's palette and the only place a colour or shape is decided. Every `--admin-*` colour has moved to a station family, so the drawer follows the light/dark switch. `drawer-kit.css` keeps 37 private `--admin-*` names — type scale, radii, alpha tints, depth family, action z-index — which have no station counterpart. The contract holds that count as a budget that may only shrink.

## Validation

From the plugin root: `npm run build`, `npm run contract:admin-station-css`, `npm run docs:check`, and browser inspection when a WordPress runtime is available.
